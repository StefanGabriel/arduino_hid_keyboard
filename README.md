# Arduino HID Keyboard Using V-USB for Arduino

There was a moment when just the laptop/desktop keyboard wasn't enough and there was a deadly virus outside and to buy online was also a danger. But you like to tinker and you have lying around an Arduino Uno board, the chinese version because you like to have more boards instead of an expensive one which you can fry easily enough. 
Besides the Arduino Board, make sure you have:
- some breadboard push buttons (I used six)
- a 4x4 8 wire keypad
- an microUSB female board (you can use an USB Type A Male connector and solder the wires at the end to the corresponding pins)
- two 3V6 Zener diodes with a power of maximum 0.5W (1W will not work)
- two 68 Ohm resistors
- one 2.2 kOhm resistor
- six 10 kOhm resistors
- microUsb Male - Type A Male cable (or the alternative from above)
- USb Type B Male - USB Type A cable (to program Arduino Uno)
- many male-male dupont wires
